# Specify an array of one or more morphlines, each of which defines an ETL
# transformation chain. A morphline consists of one or more (potentially
# nested) commands. A morphline is a way to consume records (e.g. Flume events,
# HDFS files or blocks), turn them into a stream of records, and pipe the stream
# of records through a set of easily configurable transformations on the way to
# a target application such as Solr.
